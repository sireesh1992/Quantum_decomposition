Dear Ravi and the recruiting team,

Thank you very much for offering me the opportunity to work at Xilinx. I sincerely appreciate the offer and your interest in hiring me. It was a very pleasant interviewing experience for me. I want to personally thank Padmini and Srini for taking the time for answering many of my questions about the company and role.

After much thought, I've decided to accept a position at another company as that is more in line with my career and personal aspirations at this point of time. While this position at Xilinx is a great opportunity, I feel that now is not the best time to take this up.
	  
It's been a pleasure getting to know all of you. Thanks again for your time and support. 
	  
Best regards,
Sireesh
